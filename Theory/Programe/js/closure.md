闭包 : 只有function(包括箭头函数)可以创建闭包

A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the **lexical environment**). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

In JavaScript, closures are the primary mechanism used to enable data privacy

In functional programming, closures are frequently used for partial application & currying.
